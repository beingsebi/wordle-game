# Prerequisites
* compile `main.cpp` to `main.exe`
* run `GAME.py` and have fun

### for linux only, in the `tools.py` file 
*    comment line `36` (ctypes.windll ... )
*    comment line `47` (root.iconbitmap('ico.ico'))

# Statistics
* `11454` possible answers
* `4.0103` average guesses if played only by using the helper
* 1 guess - `1` word
* 2 guesses - `43` words
* 3 guesses - `2509` words
* 4 guesses - `6512` words
* 5 guesses - `2080` words
* 6 guesses - `291` words
* 7 guesses - `18` words
* more details in `_stats.txt`

# Extra
* the `_stats.txt` file was obtained by running `get_stats.cpp` and it describes the sequence produced by the helper for any valid answer
* the `precomputed.txt` file was obtained by running get_precomputed.cpp and it is used to store the second guesses if the first guess was TAREI
